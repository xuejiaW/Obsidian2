# Obsidian2Hexo

Python tools that convert Obsidian vault to Hexo posts.

The post in [My blog](https://tuncle.blog/) is all converted by this tool.

## Background

As someone who uses Obsidian to take notes and Hexo to write blog posts, you may have noticed that there is no easy way to export your Obsidian notes directly to Hexo as a blog post.

This is where this tool comes in. Created out of a personal need for a more streamlined way to transfer notes from Obsidian to Hexo, the script automates the process of converting an Obsidian note into a Hexo post.

For my personal situation, the attachment in my obsidian note is managed by plugin [Custom Attachment Location](https://github.com/RainCat1998/obsidian-custom-attachment-location), and the callout is using [Obsidian Admonition](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions).

I prefer traditional Markdown hyperlink, thus I use `[]()` instead of `[[ ]]` in my notes.

And I am using [hexo butterfly theme](https://github.com/jerryc127/hexo-theme-butterfly).

Anyway, This tool may not work for you if you have a different setup, but you can easily modify the code to fit your needs.

## Prerequisites

This tool requires Python 3.6 or above. You should install the required packages by the following command:

```bash
pip install pypinyin
pip install python-frontmatter
```

## How to use

The tool requires two arguments: the path to the Obsidian vault and the path to the Hexo source folder. The command should follow the following format:

```bash
<Python executable> obsidian2hexo.py --hexo-posts-dir <path to Obsidian vault> --obsidian-vault-dir <path to Hexo source folder>
```

An example call would be:

```bash
python D:\Github\Obsidian2Hexo\main.py --hexo-posts-dir D:\Github\xuejiaW.github.io\source\_posts --obsidian-vault-dir C:\Users\wxj\Dropbox\PersonalNotes
```

## How it works

After parsing the Obsidian vault and hexo post folder path, the tool will do the following things:

### Create Hexo post file

- Copy all contents except the `.git` and `.obsidian` folder from the Obsidian vault to a temporary folder. The temporary folder path would be `<HexoPostFolder>/temp`，e.g `D:\Github\xuejiaW.github.io\source\_posts\temp`.
- For each markdown file in the temporary folder,which represent a note, the tool will do the following things:
    - Parse the `published` metadata in the markdown file. If the `published` metadata is `false`, the tool will skip the file. Otherwise, the tool will continue.
    - Copy the markdown file to the Hexo post folder with a normalized file name. The normalized file name would be converted from the original file name by the following rules:
        - Replace chinese characters with their pinyin.
        - Replace space with _
        - Convert all characters to lowercase.
    - Create asset folder for the markdown file in the Hexo post folder if required
        - The asset folder only be created if the `\assets\<noteName>` folder exists which means the note has assets.
        - The created asset folder path would be named as the normalized file name.
        - Copy all files in the `\assets\<noteName>` folder to the created asset folder, and make sure the file name is all lowercase.
    - Normalized the content inside the copied markdown, which will be explained in the [next section](#normalize-the-content).

#### Example

For the note file `C:\Users\wxj\Dropbox\PersonalNotes\00_Books\贪婪的多巴胺.md` in the Obsidian vault, the tool will generate the post file `D:\Github\xuejiaW.github.io\source\_posts\tan_lan_de_duo_ba_an.md` in the Hexo post folder.

And if the note has assets, i.e. the folder `C:\Users\wxj\Dropbox\PersonalNotes\00_Books\assets\贪婪的多巴胺` existed, the tool will create the asset folder `D:\Github\xuejiaW.github.io\source\_posts\tan_lan_de_duo_ba_an` and copy all assets to the folder.

### Normalize the content

The tool will normalize the content inside the copied markdown file by the following rules:

1. Normalize the hyperlink:
    1. If the hyperlink destination is a unpublished markdown file, the tool will convert the hyperlink to plain text
    2. If the hyperlink destination is a published markdown file, the tool will convert the hyperlink to the hexo post folder.
    3. If the hyperlink destination is a title of a published markdown file, the tool will further normalize the title which only convert space to underscore
    4. If the hyperlink destination is content in the asset folder, the tool will convert the hyperlink to the asset folder.
2. Convert Obsidian Admonition to Hexo Callback

#### Example

If one note in obsidian has the following content which contains a hyperlink to another note，hyperlink to asset and Obsidian admonition:

```markdown
~~~ad-note

The upper content will be converted to the following content:

```markdown
{% note info %}

{% endnote %}
